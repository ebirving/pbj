# Single Page Web Apps: Express and OOJS

Build an interactive "single page" web application that persists data.

## Learning Objectives

### Express
- Compare and contrast Javascript in the browser vs JS on the server
- Use npm to manage project dependencies
- Use module.exports and require to organize code into models, views, and controllers
- Use Handlebars templates to simplify rendering on the back-end
- Use and configure middleware like body-parser to handle form submissions
- Link to static assets in an Express application

### Express Routing

- Define the parts of a route
- Extract routes to separate files
- Explain the `all` routing method
- Describe the role of response methods
- Extract routes to a separate file

### Intro to SPA

- Compare / contrast single page applications with traditional web applications
- Explain the concept of deep linking and why it's useful
- Bootstrap an application at load
- Use the history api to update the url
- Identify common problems with single page applications

### JS Prototypes and Constructors
- Explain the importance of OOJS in front-end code
- Describe the role of constructor functions, and how they work
- Use constructor functions and the `new` keyword to create objects with shared properties (like classes)
- Describe what a prototype object is, and how they are used in JS
- Differentiate between `__proto__` and Animal.prototype
- Diagram the relationship between an object, its constructor, and prototype
- Compare `Object.create` vs constructors
- Compare / contrast classical and prototypal inheritance
- Use the Chrome element inspector to traverse through the prototypal tree.

### Sequelize

- Compare / contrast Sequelize and ActiveRecord
- Use sequelize to connect to a DB in JS
- Define a model in sequelize that has getters and setters
- Define the roll of callbacks in Sequelize
- Describe why database are asynchronous (and what asynchronous means)
- Use Sequelize to find models from the DB
- Use Sequelize to perform CRUD on model instances
- Create an API with CRUD functionality using Express and Sequelize
- Map a directory / file structure conducive to DB modeling
- Map Rails / ActiveRecord methods to Express / Sequelize methods

### OOJS 1: Reading
- use `$.ajax` to populate objects in the front end(client-side)
- differentiate between "class methods" and "instance (prototyped) methods" in JS.
- use OOJS to build model and view objects
- Utilize promises to access the response from an `$.ajax` request
- render views on the client-side utilizing JS objects in your application.


### OOJS 2: CUD

- Use AJAX

### JS TDD

- Explain the purpose of TDD/BDD.
- Review RSpec and standard testing syntax.
- Describe Jasmine.
- List components of a Jasmine test.
- Compare/Contrast Jasmine & RSpec.
- Implement TDD using Jasmine.
- Use different Jasmine matchers.
